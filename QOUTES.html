<h2>Happy Firts Month of Love, Adi <3 </h2>
<blockqoute>
<p> 
I'm so glad that we did to survive our first month. Trials in life made us weak these past few days, it came to our way like unexpectedly, we fought for it , and trying to give out our best. I know for a very short time we have stuff that we don't really understand what's going on, for the fact that I don't even get a chance to hug you, kiss you, wake up next to you, and see you everyday but what ever it takes, for this short period of time that we've been together I learned to love you so deeply. You learned to accept me for who I am. I learned to dream about having you in my life for a lifetime. I learned to sacrifice my pride.. learned to smile whenever I'm sad. I am praying and I am hoping that everything will be alright. This 1st month that we've been together proves that we really can, we can make things possible, we can put a smile on our face, we can understand each other weaknesses, and I know we can make our relationship lasts forever. I really do love you .. really do care for you .. and I really want you to be not just in my life, but in my future life. Thank you for making me feel this way. Iloveyou Adi. How can I even let you go now? Loving you is my Joy and I promise that I will not exchange you for anything and I just want you to know that you are my hope and my dream that is coming true. The bond of love can never fade when its you and me. I would love to grow old with you and witness countless monthsaries with you. I may not be perfect for you but I will strive to make everything perfect for you. Every day memories come to my mind about the wonderful times I spent with you, you're the best that I have. You're the most cute and handsome man of all and I have no eyes for anyone else. You fill my life with happiness. I learned to share the sorrows and happiness with the person I love the most. If I did not meet you, I would not be able to know that I have different kinds of emotions with me. You have given me the rare feeling of being loved and treasured by someone. I know we have experienced many ups and downs within this one month of our relationship. But I am grateful to God for giving me the best gift of my life, which is your unconditional love for me. I promise that I will love you more than myself. I love the feeling of being in love with you. I miss you even when I'm with you. The time stops for me when we're together, and everything seems the most beautiful when I'm with you. Thank you for being there for me always. A little word of love from you makes my day. When you hold my hand, I feel my heart will burst with happiness. Thank you for being my best friend and guide in life. Therefore, today I want to tell you how precious and important you are to me. ILOVEYOUSOMUCH ADI KO <333 MWAAAAAAAAAHHHH (may tunog) </p>
